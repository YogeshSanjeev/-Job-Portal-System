# Job-Portal-System
The Job Portal System is a full-stack web application developed using PHP and MongoDB, designed to streamline the process of job searching and job posting. It allows employers to create, update, and manage job listings while enabling job seekers to register, browse, and apply for jobs.

This project demonstrates essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a real-world context, with separate access levels for admin/employers and users/job seekers, and includes a user-friendly dashboard interface.
